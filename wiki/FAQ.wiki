Frequently Asked Questions

1. Can I manually add modules/documents to And Bible?

Yes, you can copy modules to a jsword directory on your sd card.  Expand the module so that the .conf file is in sdcard/jsword/mods.d and the bible files in a subdirectory of sdcard/jsword/modules e.g. sdcard\jsword\modules\texts\ztext\nettext.

Modules/documents installed via the Download screen in And Bible will be placed in an application specific directory and, in Android 2.2+, will be removed if the application is removed. 

2. How can I get help?

Either submit a question to mobile-devel@crosswire.org (see http://www.crosswire.org/mailman/listinfo/mobile-devel).
Or to help.andbible@gmail.com.

3. I just see squares instead of the Hebrew bible.

Hebrew font support was added in Android 2.2.  Although some people have found out how to add Hebrew fonts to older versions of Android that is not supported although it may work for you.

Hebrew fonts are in Android 2.2 but right-to-left support is still not available.

4. And Bible is very large

If you are on Android 2.2 then you can move it to the SD card.  And Bible was reduced from over 5 Mb to 1.5 Mb in version 0.0.14.

5. I want integration with Strong's Concordance.

Yes, it is in the pipeline and should be delivered in a few weeks.

6. Can I generate my ownindexes and manually copy them to my Android mobile.

To allow for auto-uninstall of application generated files indexes are generated to the appropriate module sub-dir of /mnt/sdcard/Android/data/net.bible.android.activity/files/lucene/Sword e.g. ESV indexes are in ../lucene/Sword/ESV.

Sword generated indexes work reliably in and-bible so you can generate them using a Sword based application like Xiphos and manually install them.

Frequently Asked Questions

No there isn't much here yet but it should grow

1. Can I manually add modules/documents to And Bible?

Yes, you can copy modules to a jsword directory on your sd card.  Expand the module so that the .conf file is in sdcard/jsword/mods.d and the bible files in a subdirectory of sdcard/jsword/modules e.g. sdcard\jsword\modules\texts\ztext\nettext.

Modules/documents installed via the Download screen in And Bible will be placed in an application specific directory and, in Android 2.2+, will be removed if the application is removed. 

2. How can I get help?

Submit a question to mobile-devel@crosswire.org (see http://www.crosswire.org/mailman/listinfo/mobile-devel).

3. I just see squares instead of the Hebrew bible.

Hebrew font support was added in Android 2.2.  Although some people have found out how to add Hebrew fonts to older versions of Android that is not supported although it may work for you.

Hebrew fonts are in Android 2.2 but right-to-left support is still not available.

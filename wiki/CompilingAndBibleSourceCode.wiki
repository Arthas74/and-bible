Eclipse is the preferred IDE for Android development.

 # Download and install jdk 1.6.  
 # Install the Android SDK.  
 # Install Eclipse 3.5 (3.6 is not yet recommended by Google)  
 # Install the Eclipse ADT plugin.  
 # Ensure Eclipse has an svn plugin e.g. see subclipse.tigris.org  
 # Check out the [http://code.google.com/p/and-bible/source/checkout And Bible source]  
 # In eclipse right-click the And Bible project and select Run As/Android Application  

= Other IDEs =

Some IDEs like IDEA already have custom embedded Android Tools which can be used.  See this [http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/other-ide.html Google Help Page] for more information.

= Ant =

Much of this information is taken from [http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/other-ide.html Google Help Page]

To compile with ant:

 # Create AndBible/local.properties based on local.properties.example  
 # Ensure jdk 1.6 is installed and on the path.  
 # Ensure the Android SDK is installed and the tools directory is on the path.  
 # Change to the AndBible project directory  
 # Run 'ant debug'

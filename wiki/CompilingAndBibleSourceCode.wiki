The following notes are a high level overview.  Please embellish and correct according to your experience.

When compiling you will notice warnings regarding anonymous inner classes.  These can be ignored and are due to libraries compiled with JDK 1.4.

= Eclipse =

Eclipse is the preferred IDE for Android development.

 # Download and install jdk 1.6.
 # Install the [http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html Android SDK].
 # Install [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ Eclipse] for Java EE developers or for Java Developers
 # Install the [http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html Eclipse ADT plugin].
 # Ensure Eclipse has a Git plugin e.g. eGit or install Git for use from the command line (see below for more details).
 # Clone the [https://github.com/mjdenham/and-bible And Bible source]
 # In eclipse right-click the And Bible project and select Run As/Android Application

An alternative way to get started quickly is to install [http://developer.motorola.com/docstools/motodevstudio/ MotoDev Studio].  I have been using this myself recently and because it comes pre-configured for Android development it is a quick way to start.

= Git =

You could take one of at least 2 approaches to get And Bible source code from Github - 1) use the EGit plugin for Eclipse 2) use pure git commands e.g 'git pull'

You will probably want to install egit anyway so if you do then you can follow the [http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#Starting_from_existing_Git_Repositories 'Starting from existing repositories'] instructions.

If you install basic command line [http://git-scm.com/ git] then you could do the following:
md andbible
cd andbible
git init
git pull git://github.com/mjdenham/and-bible.git

= Other IDEs =

Some IDEs like IDEA already have custom embedded Android Tools which can be used.  See this [http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/other-ide.html Google Help Page] for more information.

= Ant =

Much of this information is taken from [http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/other-ide.html Google Help Page]

To compile with ant:

 # Create AndBible/local.properties based on local.properties.example  
 # Ensure jdk 1.6 is installed and on the path.  
 # Ensure the Android SDK is installed and the tools directory is on the path.  
 # Change to the AndBible project directory  
 # Run 'ant debug'  

= Future Use of App Bar Compat =
The App Bar Compat library will be required in the future.  If using Eclipse this must be configured as a Library Project.

Follow [http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/setup.html#libs-with-res Adding libraries with resources] on the Android [Support Library] page.
Check <appcompat>/project.properties to ensure the compat library sdk version is consistent with And Bible's and has been downloaded using the Android SDK.

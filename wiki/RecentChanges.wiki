==Nicer Toolbar==
Implement a standard, prettier and more powerful toolbar while retaining the current shortcut buttons. As the standard Android toolbar proliferates many phones hide the Menu button and users do not know how to access anything in the menus.

==Persecuted Users==
Use less obviously Christian icon to reduce probability of causing persecution for users.

==Alternate Versifications==
Support users with different order of Bible books and different chapter divisions.

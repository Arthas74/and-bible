==Split Screen==
A lot of people have requested this.  It is useful i) for comparing 2 bibles e.g. native/Greek, native/English ii)instant commentary view e.g. ESV/JFB iii)Document selector/view iv) making (sermon) notes while reading v) unlinked so that you could have the main window open to the primary study chapter and the secondary window could be used to look up related references. (Please mention other particular uses to assist with planning).

==Speak Improvements==
Add Quick Speak button - Done.  Add Pause/FF/Rew.

==And Bible Specific Screen Timout==
I set mine default timeout to 10 minutes which I find fine, but many people have requested this so the plan is to add a new Setting allowing selection of Screen Timeout just for And Bible.  Meanwhile, if you want the screen to stay on, you could use the "Screen On" Android app to keep the screen on always when using And Bible.

#summary =Design of Personal Notes Feature

= Introduction =

Preparation for implementation of Personal Notes.  Initially a simple implementation allowing notes for any bible verse to be saved in a database on the mobile phone.

There will be an 'Edit Note' screen allowing entry and modification of notes, and a 'Notes List' allowing selection of previous notes.

Two new menu items will be made available.  'Notes' will take you to the Notes list.  'Add/Edit Note will take you to the 'Edit Note' screen.

There will initially be no synchronization, export, backup functions although these may be added in future releases.

= Details =

== Database ==
Key // OSIS key\\
Timestamp // Date-time of creation\\
Note // User note - simple text at first

Do we want some sort of Label functionality?  I think not because we don't have that in Commentaries.

== Navigation Integration ==
=== Creating a note ===
[Add|Edit] Note // from Verse menu

=== Editing a note ===
[Add|Edit] Note // from Verse menu

How to switch to Note list to pick a previous note?  Maybe 'Notes' menu item on Document menu.

=== Deleting a Note ===
Context menu on Notes list.

== Interface ==
=== Notes List ===
Passage/Contents Menu item shows list of previous notes including verse, 1st line, date (if landscape)

=== New/Edit Note ===
Current verse: read-only
Text Box: enter note here

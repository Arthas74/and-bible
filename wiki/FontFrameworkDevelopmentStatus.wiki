= Font Framework Development Status =

This page gives an overview of the current status of font framework development.

= Details =

There have been lots of e-mails regarding font problems during the past year and I have made a start with an attempt to address some of those problems.  

The main issues that have been raised are:
# Greek breathing marks are not displayed.
# Hebrew vowels not displayed because they prevent correct rtl display.
# Certain language fonts are not available on Android
# Certain language character shaping and rtl are not correct - related to 2.

Here are my current plans.

== Prototype ==
Allow experienced Sword users to associate a font with a module using sdcard/jsword/fonts folder.

== Initial Implementation - Automate font override ==
This will hopefully address Issue 1 and begin to address issue 3 for non complex languages.

1. Store fonts on a server.
2. Associate fonts with a module or language.
3. When a module is downloaded check the font association list and download a font if required.
4. When displaying a page add the css to the header to load any required font

== Shaping ==
It has been suggested that And Bible includes Graphite integration and I hope to look into this and try it out.  Any comments from current users would be appreciated.  Graphite still requires fonts to be distributed so this would build on the initial font distribution framework.

The Android integration of Graphite seems to be being refined.

== Current Status ==
I have been testing various Greek fonts with the SBLGNT module.
GentiumPlus-R.ttf - some missing chars in SBLGNT
SBL_grk.ttf - looks perfect to me
LinLibertine_R.otf - some missing chars in SBLGNT
LinBiolinum_R.otf - some missing chars in SBLGNT
GalSILR.ttf - looks good, possible missing char in Matt 1:6, etc
GalSILR-webfont.woff - woff doesn't seem to work - I think it is just Android 3.0+ but see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3200069/css-fonts-on-android for fall back technique

So it seems that there are 2 fonts that look fine

So my current I have created a wiki page here that I will update as I progress.

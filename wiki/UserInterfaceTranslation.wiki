= User Interface Translation =

If you would like to volunteer to translate the And Bible user interface into another language or to update an existing translation then either e-mail [mailto:help.andbible@gmail.com And Bible Support] or volunteer via the And Bible discussion group.

We use a web based tool named [http://amanuens.com/ Amanuens] to manage and simplify user interface translation.  Both text from And Bible and JSword can be translated via Amanuens.

Mario is the user interface translation co-ordinator.

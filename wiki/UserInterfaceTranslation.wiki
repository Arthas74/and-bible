= User Interface Translation =

If you would like to volunteer to translate the And Bible user interface into another language or to update an existing translation then either e-mail [mailto:help.andbible@gmail.com And Bible Support] or post to the And Bible discussion group.

We are slowly migrating user interface translation over to Amanuens.  Currently And Bible strings are integrated into Amanuens and we are hoping to integrate strings used by JSword library in the near future.

#summary Plans for the upcoming releases

Here are enhancements I hope to include in the upcoming releases.  Also see the UserVoice page which influences the below list.

==Split Screen==
A lot of people have requested this.  It is useful i) for comparing 2 bibles e.g. native/Greek, native/English ii)instant commentary view e.g. ESV/JFB iii)Document selector/view iv) making (sermon) notes while reading v) unlinked so that you could have the main window open to the primary study chapter and the secondary window could be used to look up related references. (Please mention other particular uses to assist with planning).

==Alternate Versification==
An increasing number of books provided by Crosswire are using non-KJV versifications and currently cannot be displayed correctly by And Bible.  Many parts of the world e.g. Eastern Europe do not use KJV versification.  

Uninspired text e.g. Tobit, must not to be confused with inspired text and so initially uninspired text will not be displayed, later it may be displayed separately e.g. in an Appendix.  This approach is controversial; some would emphasise the need to display as the module creator intended, which And Bible would not necessarily be doing.

==Improved Strongs & TEI tag support==
Support Strongs from beta and BDB Glosses for Strongs which rely on TEI.  
This is a part of the next release but is not widely utilised by current modules.  Strongs in Sword beta uses TEI but is still in beta and seems to have various other problems.

==Speak Improvements==
Add Quick Speak button.  Add Pause/FF/Rew - this is tricky and I have tried to do this already.

==Bookmark, My Note, Highlight, Label Integration==
Some people have many bookmarks and would like improved label support for bookmarks and to be able to label My Notes.  Also there are many requests for highlighting.  I plan to integrate all the above and improve labels.

==Better Book Index Navigation==
Large books like Josephus are very difficult to navigate in And Bible.

==Reorganise and simplify the Menus==
I am struggling to come up with a great idea that does not involve more clicks, but see the wiki page on this subject.

==Touch to Select Verse==
Allow multi-verse selection via touch.

==Nicer Toolbar==
Implement a prettier and more powerful toolbar while retaining the current shortcut buttons. 

==More Puritan Books==
I enjoy listening to these so I intend to keep adding them.  I am thinking of another John Owen.

==Personal Note==
I work on And Bible in my spare time so please be aware all this will happen slowly and some trickier changes may be shelved for a while.  If you would like to contribute then the source is on github.

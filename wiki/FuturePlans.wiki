Obviously this is related to UserVoice, but I don't follow UserVoice influences rather than determines future development plans.

==Nicer Toolbar==
It could be prettier but it needs to be small.  The Android Twitter ui is supposed to be a good model but the Toolbar there is very wide.  Also some have suggested allowing full page viewing but I am not sure.  

==Map Book Module Support==
Support Sword Map modules

==Improved Strongs==
Support Real Strongs (well maintained) or Strongs from beta.  Aim to have the actual Greek or Hebrew word displayed and support the different sort of links.

==Hebrew Vowels==
Cyanogen and ICS 4.0.3 have fixes for Hebrew vowels so I can show vowels for those OS's.

==Downloads==
Enhance the Download Documents screen so downloaded documents have a green tick, upgrades have an orange arrow(?)

==Hide Document Facility==
For documents you want on your mobile but don't use often or for non directly used docs like Strongs.

==Japanese Search==
I have no visibility of the number of japanese users of And Bible so don't know the priority.

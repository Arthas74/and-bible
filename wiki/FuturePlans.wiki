#summary Plans for the upcoming releases

Here are enhancements I hope to include in teh upcoming releases.  Also see the UserVoice page.

==Nicer Toolbar==
Implement a prettier and more powerful toolbar while retaining the current shortcut buttons. 

==Map Book Module Support==
Support Sword Map modules

==Improved Strongs==
Support Real Strongs (well maintained) or Strongs from beta.  Aim to have the actual Greek or Hebrew word displayed and support the different sort of links.

==Hebrew Vowels==
Cyanogen and ICS 4.0.3 have fixes for Hebrew vowels so I can show vowels for those OS's.

==Downloads==
Enhance the Download Documents screen so downloaded documents have a green tick, upgrades have an orange arrow(?)

==Reorganise and simplify the Menus==
I am struggling to come up with a great idea that does not involve more clicks, but see the wiki page on this subject.

#summary Plans for the upcoming releases

Here are enhancements I hope to include in the upcoming releases.  Also see the UserVoice page which influences the below list.

==Split Screen==
A lot of people have requested this.  It is useful i) for comparing 2 bibles e.g. native/Greek, native/English ii)instant commentary view e.g. ESV/JFB.  Please mention other particular uses to assist with planning.

==Alternate Versification==
An increasing number of books provided by Crosswire are using non-KJV versifications and currently cannot be displayed correctly by And Bible.  Many parts of the world e.g. Eastern Europe do not use KJV versification.  I will outline plans more clearly later, but one aim I have is not to allow uninspired text to be confused with inspired text.

==Improved Strongs & TEI tag support==
Support Strongs from beta and BDB which rely on TEI.  Aim to have the actual Greek or Hebrew word displayed and support the different sort of links.

==Better Book Index Navigation==
Large books like Josephus are very difficult to navigate in And Bible.

==Reorganise and simplify the Menus==
I am struggling to come up with a great idea that does not involve more clicks, but see the wiki page on this subject.

==Nicer Toolbar==
Implement a prettier and more powerful toolbar while retaining the current shortcut buttons.

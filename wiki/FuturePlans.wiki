#summary Plans for the upcoming releases

Here are enhancements I hope to include in the upcoming releases.  Also see the [https://andbible.uservoice.com UserVoice page] which influences the below list.

==Alternate Versification==
An increasing number of bibles provided by Crosswire are using non-KJV alternate versifications (av11n) and currently cannot be displayed correctly by And Bible.  Many parts of the world e.g. Eastern Europe do not use KJV versification.  

Uninspired text e.g. Tobit, must not to be confused with inspired text and so initially uninspired text will not be displayed, later it may be displayed separately e.g. in an Appendix.  This approach is controversial; some would emphasise the need to display as the module creator intended, which And Bible would not necessarily be doing.

And Bible uses the JSword library to access documents and will not support av11n bibles until JSword has completed av11n support.

==Technical Changes==
Build with Gradle.  This is Google's future planned build mechanism.
Add Guice to facilitate unit testing and dependencies between different sections of code.
More unit tests, starting with the XML->HTML conversion.

==Bookmark, My Note, Highlight, Label Integration==
Some people have many bookmarks and would like improved label support for bookmarks and to be able to label My Notes.  Also there are many requests for highlighting.  I plan to integrate all the above and improve labels.

==Better Book Index Navigation==
Large books like Josephus are very difficult to navigate in And Bible.

==Reorganise and simplify the Menus==
I am struggling to come up with a great idea that does not involve more clicks, but see the wiki page on this subject.

==Touch to Select Verse==
Allow multi-verse selection via touch.

==Nicer Toolbar==
Implement a prettier and more powerful toolbar while retaining the current shortcut buttons. 

==More Puritan Books==
I enjoy listening to these so I intend to keep adding them.  I added 'Communion with God' by John Owen recently.

==Lookup Word in Dictionary==
If page is not auto-scrolling a single touch on  a word will invoke a lookup on all installed dictionaries with a pop-up box to show results.  E.g. touch Gilgal would show an occurrence in ISBE, possibly elsewhere too.

==Personal Note==
I work on And Bible in my spare time so please be aware all this will happen slowly and some trickier changes may be shelved for a while.  If you would like to contribute then the source is on github.
